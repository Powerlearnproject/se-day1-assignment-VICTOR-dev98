Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is writing instructions in code form for computer. 
The importance of software engineering is solving real-world problems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The introduction or birth of software engineering
The introduction of the model Waterfall which is defines sequential phases.
Rise of Agile methodologies that deals with iterative development

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning - the phase starts with defining project goals, feasibility, and resource requirements.
Requirememnt analysis - stakeholders then document software  requirements, ensuring a clear understanding of what the system should achieve.
Design - planning of technical specifications such as system architecture, database design and user interfaces.
Implementation - Based on the designed specification, the developer embarks in writing the actual code.
Testing - there is rigorous testing of the software to identify and fix defects.
Deployment - the software is released to the users.
Maintenance - The software is monitored after deployment to update fixed bugs and improve performance and changes adaptive to the requirements.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodologies follows a sequential and linear process where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. In contrast, agile is flexible and iterative that emphasizes on continuos development and customer feedback. 
Waterfall methodologies is used in Financial and banking systems whereas Agile is used in startups where quick feedback are needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - The key role of the developer is designing, coding, and implementing software solutions based on project requirements. Some key responsibilities is like writing a clean and maintainable code, debugging and fixing software defects, and documenting code and software architecture.
Quality Assurance Engineer - The engineer ensures the software meets quality standards by identifying and fixing defects before release. The key responsibilities is designing and executing test cases and identifying, reporting, and tracking bugs.
Project Manager - The project manager oversees the entire project lifecycle ensuring timely delivery, management of the budget anf effective communication.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Both IDEs and VCS improve software development by enhancing productivity, collaboration, and code quality. VIsual Studio Code is an example of IDEs and a widely used VCS is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Troubleshooting and Debugging code can be time-consuming.
Meeting deadlines can lead to stress and poor-quality code.
Also keeping up with new techology is also a challenge.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit testing involves testing individual functions and components of a program. Its importance is catching bugs early and debugging.
Integration testing test different modules interacting with each other. It identifies defects in data flow and ensures smooth communication between components.
System testing  validates that the entire application meets functional and non-functional requirements. It detects performance bottlenecks and verifies overall compliance with specification.
Acceptance testing is where the software is evaluated by end-users to confirm it meets business requirements. It validates real-world usability.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is giving instruction or writing a set of commands asking AI to do something.
The importance of Prompt engineering is one is able to give clear instruction to your AI assistance.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt :- Create a report about software development

Write a 2-page report on the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle , including Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.

The improved prompt is clear enough, more specific, and concise.
